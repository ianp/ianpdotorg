    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Excellent <a href="http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2012/10/search-me/">article</a> over at <a href="http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/">Gizmodo</a> about the whole security theatre dance that we’re forced to do any time we want to fly these days. My favourite quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t have a problem with being searched at all – in fact, if you guys think it’s necessary, I’d be the first to admit that I look a little bit suspicious before I’ve had my first cup of coffee in the morning – but if you’re going to stroke me gently in front of hundreds of people, you’d better buy me a fucking drink first, is all I am saying.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been looking at ways to reduce the number of power adapters I need
to carry around wqith me. My first thought was to get a USB charger for
my phone, but <a href="http://www.igo.com">this</a> seems like a good idea as well.
I’m hoping that they have an adapter for the Apple
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod">iPod</a> as well, then I can go from three
adapters to one in a single step, and get DC charging as well (for in
flight power on planes mostly).</p>
