  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although it’s an open source project that anybody can help out with, in
practice <a href="http://rvsnoop.org/">RvSnoop</a> is developed by me at present. However, a couple
of people have asked — either in the forums or by email — what the
current development status is. Well, in a word, it’s going slower than I
had planned! However, I’ll start posting to this blog a little about
what I’m working on and what my current plans are, and also try to start
making more frequent releases. I’ll rearrange the distributables
slightly as well, given the speed of most connections these days I no
longer see the point of keeping a <em>binary only</em> download so I’m just
goint to include the compressed source and API docs will all of the
releases, this will be labelled as the <em>RvSnoop Stable</em> release. I’ll
make more frequent releases of the code that I am working on as a
<em>RvSnoop Development</em> release. But first, a little explanation of what
you can expect from these unstable releases. I’ll post later about my
plans for the upcoming releases.</p>

<h3 id="its-all-greek-to-me">It’s All Greek To Me</h3>

<p>Projects use diffferent terminology for there release schedules, here’s how I’m
using the terms.</p>

<h4 id="alpha">Alpha</h4>

<p>If a release is labelled <em>alpha</em> then
it means that I am still adding new features and working on major known
bugs. Once the release is feature complete and all of the major bugs
have been squashed I’ll go through and clean up all of the strings,
finally I’ll spend some time cleaning up any glaring UI problems. Once
this is complete I’ll relabel the release <em>beta</em>.</p>

<h4 id="beta">Beta</h4>

<p>Moving
forward one of the main points about the <em>beta</em> release is that it
will be considered to be a <em>string freeze</em> release. I’m aiming for
release 1.7 to be fully prepared for internationalization and hopefully
some of the people who have been using RvSnoop will help out with
translations. Also at this point the UI will be basically finished, so
the beta releases are for testing and minor bug fixing. Also during this
phase I will run all of the analysis tasks (currently only <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/">PMD</a>,
but more are planned) and clean up whatever they reveal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why the fuck does <a href="https://jlog.dev.java.net/">this</a> exist exactly? It seems to be like some
twisted rite of passage that Java developers need to write their own
logging API. I confess that I’ve even suffered from this although, in my
defence, I kept <a href="http://rvsnoop.org/">mine</a> to a single class and plan to throw it away
in the very near future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s time to try a new IDE again!</p>

<p>Here’s what sucks about netbeans this time around. I should say before I start that I’m using a beta release
(6.0 M3 2006-09-19-1800 to be specific) but anything that is obviously
new functionality I’m not going to comment on, this is all stuff that
has been around for a good long while now and so I think that these
complaints are valid. If I find anything that looks especially cool
about the new version I <em>will</em> mention it though, even if it’s a bit
rough around the edges for now.</p>

<h3 id="general-points">General Points</h3>

<p>It’s still ugly as arse on the Mac. This is a problem with all Java IDEs on Mac OS X but
NetBeans has it in spades. It’s far worse than Idea and Eclipse when it
comes to visual appearance. There are hardly any refactorings available
when compared to Eclipse or Idea, I mean, even basic stuff like ‘inline’
is missing.</p>

<p>On the plus side, one of the reasons that I’m looking at
NetBeans again is to try out Jackpot, and when that’s included as
standard it shoudl leapfrog the other IDEs in terms of refactoring and
code re-engineering support. Next, the support for editing keybinding is
pretty lame. For example, there appears to be no way of assigning a
keyboard shortcut that selects all text between the insertion point and
the start of the line (or end of the line for that matter).</p>

<h3 id="find--search">Find &amp; Search</h3>

<p>There are a number of issues with the find functionality. I’ve
been mainly invoking it through control + F7 (find usages), so these
comments apply specifically to that, but some of them are general to all
of the find features of the IDE.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>After a find, if I ckick refresh I have to then go through all of the dialogs again before the refresh is run. Just refresh the fucking search, OK?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the find results window, if the result that I am interested in is in a new file I need to selct it <em>twice!</em> The first time just opens the file but doesn’t jump to the line, I have to select it again to get to the actual line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I always have to click through a dialog asking whether I want to search in
comments or not. I’m not against this as an option but I should be able
to select a default setting then I don’t have to get this dialog every
time (maybe a ‘do not show this dialog again’ checkbox?).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Urghh! Enough already! In their defence, the last couple of
times I’ve tried NetBeans it has just collapsed horribly in a steaming
pile of stack trace, so they are making improvements, but it’s got a
looong way to go beforfe it’s useable day-to-day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some discussion in <a href="http://jroller.com/page/gfx/?anchor=lightzone_a_fantastic_java_app">the comments on Romain’s weblog</a> regarding Java
applications that install private VMs. People seem to be either arguing
for or against including a VM, but there is obviously a better way. What
the installer should really do is check for a suitable JVM and if it
can’t find one, offer to download it.</p>

<p>Of course the application launcher
would also need to perform the same check in case it gets removed at a
later date. One (commercial) solution which seems to do this is
<a href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html">Install4J</a> although I can’t verify how successful the approach is
as I haven’t used it personally.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> There is a new version of Install4J out now and the entry level price point is into 4 figures, so I won’t be using it any time soon.</p>
