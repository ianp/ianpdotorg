  <div class="entry-content"><p>A new development build of <a href="http://rvsnoop.org/">RvSnoop</a> is available for
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/rvsn00p/rvsnoop-356-bin.tgz">downloading</a>. This release contains all of the features that will
be in the finished 1.6 release, due out sometime next week. Changes from
the last development build include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for republishing on different connections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added column to ledger to display wire size of messages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed bug that caused republished messages to be filtered incorrectly from the subject hierarchy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed bug with ledger renderer which caused striping to break when columns were added/removed from the view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minor code clean-ups and removal of a couple of unused methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Updated the FAQs page with correct details of timestamp formatting in ledger (this hasn’t been pushed out to the public site yet).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The only things left to do now (assuming no new bugs are found)
are some additional testing and documentation updates.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A new development version of <a href="http://rvsnoop.org/">RvSnoop</a> is now available for
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/rvsn00p/rvsnoop-353-bin.tgz">download</a>. This version adds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Saving and restoring messages between sessions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove Connection as a context sensitive menu option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved drag and drop support.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And also fixes some bugs
involving the screen menu on Mac OS X. The save and restore messages
option writes the selected records from the ledger to a ZIP based binary
file format (it’s the same format that is used internally by the copy
and paste mechanism). The format has also been enhanced to include
subject information for the messages, as this is stripped out by the raw
Rendezvous library calls.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently (according to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/macmojo/archive/2006/11/03/it-s-all-in-the-numbers.aspx">this</a>) Mac Office is 30,000,000 lines of
code, that’s a lot of code to try to keep bug free! Out of curiosity, I
downloaded <a href="http://www.kclee.de/clemens/java/javancss/">a utility to count lines of code</a> and found that
<a href="http://rvsnoop.org/">RvSnoop</a> is only ~7,000 lines of code. That’s only counting
non-comment lines, I don’t know how well commented the MS codebase is.
Not that there’s any real comparison in functionality between the two of
course!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The latest version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> has made several changes to the UI
(again), most of them not for the better as can be read about
<a href="http://dsandler.org/wp/archives/2006/09/12/itunes-7-dissection">here</a>. Still, at least one of the annoyances, the use of all
capitals for section headings in the source list, can be easily
corrected. The section headings are stored as localizable strings in a
resource file; so first shut down iTunes, then just open the
<code>/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Localizable.strings</code>
in a text editor (e.g. <a href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a>) and search for the following
lines:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ini"><span class="line"><span class="na">&quot;135.011&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;LIBRARY&quot;;</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="na">&quot;135.013&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;STORE&quot;;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="na">&quot;135.014&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;PLAYLISTS&quot;;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>these need changing to:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ini"><span class="line"><span class="na">&quot;135.011&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Library&quot;;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="na">&quot;135.012&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Devices&quot;;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="na">&quot;135.013&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Store&quot;;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="na">&quot;135.014&quot;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Playlists&quot;;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>or anything else that you like. Now when you restart iTunes it should
all look better.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> You also want to change this line: <code>"135.006" = "SHARED";</code> to this: <code>"135.006" = "Shared";</code></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A new version of <a href="http://www.1060.org/">1060 NetKernel</a> was released today, version 3.1. I
had a brief play around with the previous release but never really had
the time to dig into it too deeply. It always looked pretty neat though,
a possible good solution to base adapter (in the Tibco sense) style
components on. One of the <a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=50D78082263C424820791B1886C6C971">advertised</a> features of the new release
is a newly written ‘Getting Started Guide’, so this may be a good
opportunity to have another look.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For <a href="http://rvsnoop.prg/">RvSnoop</a> I’m currently working on adding namespaces to all of
the files that are used to save the application preferences and also the
project files. This is a Good Thing in and of itself, as it allows me to
use <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML Schema</a> to validate and document the files formats. But,
more importantly, it gives me the opportunity to refactor as I go alond,
the general plan is to make the projects in the next release be based on
directories rather than a single XML file, this will allow me to use a
disk based storage mechanism for messages so that they will be
persistent across sessions.</p>

<h3 id="playing-well-with-others">Playing Well With Others</h3>

<p>At the same
time, I’ve taken the opportunity to include some of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/index.html">Commons</a> libraries in the build. There were (well, still are) a
number of small utility classes scattered around which I’m planning on
replacing with the versions from Apache. One side effect of this is that
the build is increasing in size, to help control this I’m going to
remove the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/je/index.html">Berkeley DB</a> dependency from the build. I was
origiannly planning to use this for the on disk message store but I’ve
changed my mind here. My current thinking is to just write the messages
out to files but to have a set of indexes (probably built using
<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html">Lucene</a>) as well for searching and sorting. There should be
another (alpha) release out later this week with the Commons and
Berkeley DB changes complete, and a release next week with the new
project structure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although it’s an open source project that anybody can help out with, in
practice <a href="http://rvsnoop.org/">RvSnoop</a> is developed by me at present. However, a couple
of people have asked — either in the forums or by email — what the
current development status is. Well, in a word, it’s going slower than I
had planned! However, I’ll start posting to this blog a little about
what I’m working on and what my current plans are, and also try to start
making more frequent releases. I’ll rearrange the distributables
slightly as well, given the speed of most connections these days I no
longer see the point of keeping a <em>binary only</em> download so I’m just
goint to include the compressed source and API docs will all of the
releases, this will be labelled as the <em>RvSnoop Stable</em> release. I’ll
make more frequent releases of the code that I am working on as a
<em>RvSnoop Development</em> release. But first, a little explanation of what
you can expect from these unstable releases. I’ll post later about my
plans for the upcoming releases.</p>

<h3 id="its-all-greek-to-me">It’s All Greek To Me</h3>

<p>Projects use diffferent terminology for there release schedules, here’s how I’m
using the terms.</p>

<h4 id="alpha">Alpha</h4>

<p>If a release is labelled <em>alpha</em> then
it means that I am still adding new features and working on major known
bugs. Once the release is feature complete and all of the major bugs
have been squashed I’ll go through and clean up all of the strings,
finally I’ll spend some time cleaning up any glaring UI problems. Once
this is complete I’ll relabel the release <em>beta</em>.</p>

<h4 id="beta">Beta</h4>

<p>Moving
forward one of the main points about the <em>beta</em> release is that it
will be considered to be a <em>string freeze</em> release. I’m aiming for
release 1.7 to be fully prepared for internationalization and hopefully
some of the people who have been using RvSnoop will help out with
translations. Also at this point the UI will be basically finished, so
the beta releases are for testing and minor bug fixing. Also during this
phase I will run all of the analysis tasks (currently only <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/">PMD</a>,
but more are planned) and clean up whatever they reveal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s time to try a new IDE again!</p>

<p>Here’s what sucks about netbeans this time around. I should say before I start that I’m using a beta release
(6.0 M3 2006-09-19-1800 to be specific) but anything that is obviously
new functionality I’m not going to comment on, this is all stuff that
has been around for a good long while now and so I think that these
complaints are valid. If I find anything that looks especially cool
about the new version I <em>will</em> mention it though, even if it’s a bit
rough around the edges for now.</p>

<h3 id="general-points">General Points</h3>

<p>It’s still ugly as arse on the Mac. This is a problem with all Java IDEs on Mac OS X but
NetBeans has it in spades. It’s far worse than Idea and Eclipse when it
comes to visual appearance. There are hardly any refactorings available
when compared to Eclipse or Idea, I mean, even basic stuff like ‘inline’
is missing.</p>

<p>On the plus side, one of the reasons that I’m looking at
NetBeans again is to try out Jackpot, and when that’s included as
standard it shoudl leapfrog the other IDEs in terms of refactoring and
code re-engineering support. Next, the support for editing keybinding is
pretty lame. For example, there appears to be no way of assigning a
keyboard shortcut that selects all text between the insertion point and
the start of the line (or end of the line for that matter).</p>

<h3 id="find--search">Find &amp; Search</h3>

<p>There are a number of issues with the find functionality. I’ve
been mainly invoking it through control + F7 (find usages), so these
comments apply specifically to that, but some of them are general to all
of the find features of the IDE.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>After a find, if I ckick refresh I have to then go through all of the dialogs again before the refresh is run. Just refresh the fucking search, OK?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the find results window, if the result that I am interested in is in a new file I need to selct it <em>twice!</em> The first time just opens the file but doesn’t jump to the line, I have to select it again to get to the actual line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I always have to click through a dialog asking whether I want to search in
comments or not. I’m not against this as an option but I should be able
to select a default setting then I don’t have to get this dialog every
time (maybe a ‘do not show this dialog again’ checkbox?).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Urghh! Enough already! In their defence, the last couple of
times I’ve tried NetBeans it has just collapsed horribly in a steaming
pile of stack trace, so they are making improvements, but it’s got a
looong way to go beforfe it’s useable day-to-day.</p>
