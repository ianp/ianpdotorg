From an
[article](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/29/technology/29SOFT.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5007&en=e2282d3463a0f485&ex=1380168000
"To Fix Software Flaws, Microsoft Invites Attack") in the New York
times: \> The security flaws Mr. Kean's team is scrambling to catch and
patch are part \> of the larger problem with software today. The
programs that people rely on \> for all manner of tasks --- from writing
reports and sending e-mail, to \> monitoring factory floors and managing
electric power grids --- are becoming \> increasingly large, complex
and, all but inevitably, filled with bugs. I just don't agree about the
inevitability of it, software is filled with bugs because people like it
that way. I'm serious. If people wanted software that was virtually bug
free they could have it. Right now. It's a matter of cost though. In
\_real\_ mission critical systems (e.g. flight computers, life support
systems, the controls for nuclear reactors, etc.) I would expect to find
a very low level of bugs. I'd also expect to have to pay somewhat more
than $500 for it.
