I've just written my first _.net_ program! (Using [mono](http://www.go-mono.com)) It seems _very_ similar to Java, I'm going to grab a book and have a play with it some more over the next few days. Of course, I'm really trying to learn Lisp, but since the books I bought have been stranded in Vienna it seems like I may have to wait a few weeks for that.
