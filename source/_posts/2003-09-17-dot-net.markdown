I've just written my first \_.net\_ program! (Using
[mono](http://www.go-mono.com)) It seems \_very\_ similar to Java, I'm
going to grab a book and have a play with it some more over the next few
days. Of source, I'm really trying to learn Lisp, but since the books I
bought have been stranded in Vienna it seems like I may have to wait a
few weeks for that.
