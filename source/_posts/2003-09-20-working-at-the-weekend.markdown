Again. Something I said that I'd never do again. Again... although at
the moment I've not really got too much to do other than be here.
Probably spend the rest of the evening coding on my current personal
project, Message Explorer. \*Update:\* A bunch of the code that I
started writing for Message Explorer has been incorporated into
[RvSnoop][RVS]. [RVS]: http://rvsnoop.org/
