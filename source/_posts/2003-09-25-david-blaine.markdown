I used to read Tom Coates' weblog regularly, and came back to it after a
break today. [This post](http://www.plasticbag.org "plasticbag.org |
weblog") pretty much sums up my thoughts about David Blaine, and is very
funny at the same time. My favourite quote? \> ...you too could make it
if you just ate less mexican food and got your \> teeth fixed.
