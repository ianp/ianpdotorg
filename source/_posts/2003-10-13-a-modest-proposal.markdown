[Seth](http://www.gnome.org/\~seth): How about this (it was the first
thing that came to mind) - 'Create a desktop operating system that
allows a single support operator to maintain 10,000 user wokstations.'
There are certainly huge implications for ease of administration and
scalability there, but probably even more so for ease of use. Hell, it's
probably not even a realistic target, what with human nature and all.
