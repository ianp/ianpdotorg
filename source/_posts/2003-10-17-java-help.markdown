I had a look at the [Java Help
API](http://java.sun.com/products/javahelp) today, hoping to use it in
an application that I'm writing, alas no. Despite claiming to be
interface based, and coming with a reference implementation from Sun,
what we now call the \_service provider\_ pattern, it's irrevocably tied
to Swing. This means that you couldn't use it to say, provide a help
system on an interactive web based system, or an
[SWT](http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-swt-home/main.html
"Standard Widget Toolkit") based client side app, which is what I'm
interested in. Sun seem to be more interested in pushing their own ideas
onto others than in producing a solid solution. Here's hoping version 3
of the API solves this, but don't hold your breath.
