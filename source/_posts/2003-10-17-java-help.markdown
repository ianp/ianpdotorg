I had a look at the [Java Help API][JH] today, hoping to use it in an application that I'm writing, alas no. Despite claiming to be interface based, and coming with a reference implementation from Sun, what we now call the _service provider_ pattern, it's irrevocably tied to Swing. This means that you couldn't use it to say, provide a help system on an interactive web based system, or an [SWT][SWT] based client side app, which is what I'm interested in.

Sun seem to be more interested in pushing their own ideas onto others than in producing a solid solution. Here's hoping version 3 of the API solves this, but don't hold your breath.
