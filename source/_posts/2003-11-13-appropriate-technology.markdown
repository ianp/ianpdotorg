[This](http://www.softwarereality.com/soapbox/softwarefashion.jsp
"Software Fashion - Software Reality") says it all: \> Web services
technology also gets more than its fair share of misuse. Web \> services
are great, if that's really what you need. The problem arises when \>
people use web services 'just because', or apply web services \>
inappropriately, like using \> SOAP as an internal \> messaging bus. We
get this all the time in RFC's and RFP's at work, the obligatory how do
you support web services question. For internal integration projects.
Urghh... .
