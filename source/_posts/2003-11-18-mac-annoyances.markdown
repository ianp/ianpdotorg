[John Gruber][DF] takes issue with external editor support in apples new XCode application. I'm wondering what the Mac is like as a development platform? I love the hardware, and there are lots of neat things about the Mac, but is it a viable platform to switch to?

*Update:* Yes, it is. I switched a few months after this was written and haven't looked back.
