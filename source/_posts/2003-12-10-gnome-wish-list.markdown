My thoughts on the [OS News](http://www.osnews.com) Gnome wish list,
[others](http://www.burtonini.com/cgi/pyblosxom.cgi/computers/gnome-wishlist-pah-20031210)
have already commented. Now I haven't been following too closely the new
features in 2.6, but here's my thoughts anyway: \* \*Nautilus
Scripting\* a new plugin API and smart menu merging would go a long way
to making Nautilus cooler, assuming of course that developers step up to
the base and write plugins for it! And by the way, we really need to
change the (legally incredibly dodgy) icon for this app! \* \*Spatial
Mode\* I can't wait for this, assuming the implementation doesn't
totally suck it will be way cool. \* \*Metacity Features\* Viewports ==
Crack. But the magnetic windows feature in metacity is broken, so it's
fair game for criticism as far as I'm concerned. \* \* File Selector\*
The new file selector \_does\_ suck. As far as I can see the two
problems with the current file selector are that it looks ugly as fuck,
and that it lacks even basic features. The proposed new design solves
the fugly problem but doesn't appear to add any features. I'd like to
see, at least, improved filtering, and more details of files being
displayed. \* \*Development Tools\* I don't use Glade so I don't know
whether it sucks or not. I suspect the same is true of Eugenia so these
comments don't really seem fair. That said, what I'd really like to see
is a GUI builder integrated with Eclipse, maybe as a new back end for
the [VE](http://www.eclipse.org/vep "Visual Editor") project. \* \*Drag
and drop, copy and paste\* Yeah, this sucks, but now that there are Free
Desktop specs for this the situation should improve. I'll update this as
I get time over the next couple of days.
