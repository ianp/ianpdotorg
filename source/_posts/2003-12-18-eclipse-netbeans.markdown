Talk of merging [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) and
[NetBeans](http://www.netbeans.org) is off then, according to
[this](http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/751 "Partial Eclipse") recent
post. I can't say that I'm surprised, since many of the differences
between the two 'platforms' have become religious issues. What I'd like
to see, however, is soome commonality and code sharing between the two
where it makes sense. For example in the resource management / virtual
file system APIs, or their action API. This kind of thing would make
writing plugins that work with multiple IDEs much easier, and would
avoid duplication of effort, allowing the developers to enhance the two
products in new ways.
