What [Charles Miller](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org "The Fish Bowl")
forgets is that the ability to hold irrational opinions is taught at an
early age by a large number of schools in the states. That whole
[Creationism](http://www.holysmoke.org/cretins/cre.htm) thing just
cracks me up every time I hear somebody mention it (God given right
Charles? What \`were\` you thinking when you wrote that!). To answer
Lonita in the comments who mentions the right to bear arms, that's an
irrational belief as well. My understanding is that you get to keep and
bear arms in order to be able to defend yourself from the tyranny of the
government; now, is that really a practical attitude to take in an age
where arms capable of doing this must, of necessity, include tanks,
aircraft, chemical and biological agents and so on?
