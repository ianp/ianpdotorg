I've spent a bit of time trying to come up with a new design for this
site, all using nice, clean, XHTML and CSS, and as part of this I've
been trying to make the site look less blocky and have more rounded
edges and stuff in the design. I've come to the conclusion that this
really sucks. The suppport for CSS, especially layer 3, is still way too
weak for this to work. So, back to the drawing board, but at least I
produced a couple of reasonable icons that I can reause, ho hum.
