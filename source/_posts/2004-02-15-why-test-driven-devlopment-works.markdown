From a Salon
[interview](http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1997/10/09interview.html)
with Ellen Ullman: \> When you're around really serious professional
programmers, this \> code jockey stuff really falls away, and there is a
recognition \> that the best programmers spend a lot of time thinking
first, and \> working out the algorithms on paper or in their heads, at
a white \> board, walking. Is this one of the reasons why test driven
development is successful? It forces you to take a step back and
consider the problem in a greater level of detail before you start
writing code. If it's not the main reason then I think it's a large
influencing factor. Several of the XP practices exhibit this behaviour
(more thinking, less typing) in fact, despite it's name. Take pair
programming, if you're forced to work with somebody and explain what you
are doing then you are forced to think about your work at least to the
level of articulating your thoughts to another.
