Well, I mentioned this many a time whilst I was consulting at
[Three](http://www.three.com) as being something that they should
definitely offer, but it seems like [Vodafone](http://www.vodafone.com)
have beaten them to it. They
[announced](http://www.vodafone.com/article\_with\_thumbnail/0,3038,CATEGORY\_ID%253D102%2526LANGUAGE\_ID%253D0%2526CONTENT\_ID%253D214962,00.html)
a few days ago that they'd soon be offering 3G data services throughout
pretty much most of Europe. Looks like 3 could soon be a thing of the
past, I really don't fancy their chances in the marketplace now the big
V is moving in.
