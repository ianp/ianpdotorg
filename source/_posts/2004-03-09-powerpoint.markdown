Now, I like David Byrne's stuff quite a bit, but we obviously have
different definitions of the word professional: 'PowerPoint can make
almost anything appear good and look professional. Quite frankly, I find
that a little bit frightening.' (from
[Wired](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.04/rave.html?pg=4&topic=&topic\_set=))
For an opinion closer to my own, compare
[this](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/powerpoint "The Cognitive Style
Of PowerPoint").
