I've been looking at ways to reduce the number of power adapters I need
to carry around wqith me. My first thought was to get a USB charger for
my phone, but [this](http://www.igo.com) seems like a good idea as well.
I'm hoping that they have an adapter for the Apple
[iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod) as well, then I can go from three
adapters to one in a single step, and get DC charging as well (for in
flight power on planes mostly).
