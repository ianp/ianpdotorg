Why would the developers of [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org) want to offer
LZW compression as an option in the save as tiff dialog of said
application? When you try to select this it just whines about a patent
issue and then the save fails. It seems to me that it would be far
better to just not offer the option, or only offer the option when it
can be fulfilled. Let's hope that they'll fix this in an upcoming
release, it doesn't seem like it would be much work for somebody alreay
familiar with the code base.
