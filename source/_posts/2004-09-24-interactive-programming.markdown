After playing around with Lisp for a few days I've diverted myself back
to a small Java project. Almost immediately I'm missing the Lisp
environment! To be sure there are some things that I prefer about my
Java environment, which is [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org), but I just
miss having an interactive top-level so much! It's just amazingly
convenient to be able to try sunning a fragment of code, and the ability
to tweak it and try again if you hit any problems is such a productvity
boost.
