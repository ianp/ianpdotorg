I've been looking for a good text editor for the Mac for a few weeks
now, since I just can't seem to get the hang of
[BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml), and $180
seems a bit steep for a text editor (or maybe I'm just a tightwad). Just
released though is [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com), which seems to
fit the bill so far, and is reasonably customisable. One of the neat
features is the ability to group files together into projects, which I
expect to be a big time saver. Another win is the fact that it's easy to
set up custom syntax highlighting and add additional commands to the
editor. After a couple of hours of use I had a custom syntax mode for
C\# defined, and commands to compile and run the current file using
[Mono](http://www.go-mono.org). I'll post them here once they're a bit
more polished.
