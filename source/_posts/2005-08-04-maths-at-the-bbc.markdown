As reported at the [BBC
News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4745205.stm) site, 'One in
seven new mobiles faulty', the opening line of the article is 'An
estimated two million of the 18 million mobiles sold last year in the UK
could have been faulty', so, clearly, elementary maths isn't a
requirement for passing most media studies courses these days.
