According to [this](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4424254.stm)
article by the BBC it seems that people are now suing Sony over their
(admittedly appalling) tactic of infecting their customers PCs with
shoddily written viruses. You have to ask yourself though, how many
people are going to sign up for the class action if it means admitting
to purchasing CDs by such great names as \_Celine Dion\_ and \_Ricky
Martin?\_
