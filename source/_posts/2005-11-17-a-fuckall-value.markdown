I've noticed this trend in several marketing pushes, to state a value
for goods given away for free. Now, the wording in the title (e.g. 'A
$10 value') is mainly American, but it's a pretty universal phenomenon.
But I have to ask myself, how can this be so? Well, let's pick a single
example here, [Click Facts](http://clickfacts.com) advertise their free
service as a '$150 value', so, if it's really got that value then
somebody somewhere must be selling quite a few very similar services for
that amount of hard currency (because, well, that's pretty much the
textbook definition of value, right?). An admittedly brief search of the
web turned up exactly zero competitors for this service that were
managing to charge serious cash for what they do. There really should be
a law about this, let's call it zero-bullshit and lobby for it in all
elections from now on...
