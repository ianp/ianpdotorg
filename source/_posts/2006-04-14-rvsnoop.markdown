I've taken over pretty much all of the development of the
[rvSnoop](http://rvsnoop.org) utility now, the first major new release
has been put out today with a number of changes in it. Here, briefly,
are the plans for the next few versions: \* A graphical widget to
display messages instead of the text field. \* More import/export
formats for messages. \* General user interface clean-up. \* Better
documentation. I'll have more plans once I get to know the code a little
better. \* Add a new action to delete connections. \* Add support for
viewing serialized Java objects. \* Move the preferences to a separate
dialog. \* Add support for editing messages before republishing. Along
with some more code cleanup. After that I'm planning to push for a 2.0
release which should contain a much more robust export mechanism,
persistent record ledgers, and graphical charts. Finally, once the code
settles down a bit I'm going to look into supporting EMS messages (as a
separate project, emsSnoop).
