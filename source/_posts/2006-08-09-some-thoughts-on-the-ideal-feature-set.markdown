Commenting on [Are your users stuck in 'P' mode?][01]. I'd see the green
& purple circles as about the same size, but offset slightly, like this:
![The Ideal Feature Set](/images/2006/08/venn-ideal-features.png) There
should definitely be a large overlap between the two, but the product
should be able to do a few things that the user isn't up to yet, in
other words it should actively help the user to 'raise her game' and
improve. In a product for complete beginners (in whatever domain) this
could simply take the form of wizards that guide the user through
various tasks while explaining how to do them manually in future (and
the implication here is that they explain how the manual process
introduces more flexibility/options otherwise why not just always use
the wizard). At the same time, the user should be a bit ahead of the
product in a few areas, I feel that this is important as this is where
we will improve our product for the next release. The beauty of this is
that each user will overlap in a different way, so by satisfying the
needs of any 2 different users we should always be able to stay in this
position. ![Too Few Features](/images/2006/08/venn-too-few-features.png)
The trick to working like this is to discern when the 2 circles are
starting to diverge in size, i.e. when our product is starting to fall
behind users needs (the purple circle is expading away from the green)
and we need to spend more effort adding the features that they need; or,
when the opposite is happening, and the product is capable of doing way
more than the user (this is the original 'P' mode scenario). [01]:
