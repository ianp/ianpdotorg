There is nothing more annoying than people who insist on standing up and
talking loudly on their mobile phones in the middle of an open plan
office (just one more reason why open plan offices suck arse). At least
in the past it was just a few ignorant tossers who did this, but now
with [Skype][SK] a whole bunch of otherwise considerate people seem to
think it's fine to yammer away at high volume while sat at their PCs.
