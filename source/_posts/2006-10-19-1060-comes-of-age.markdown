A new version of [1060 NetKernel][NK] was released today, version 3.1. I
had a brief play around with the previous release but never really had
the time to dig into it too deeply. It always looked pretty neat though,
a possible good solution to base adapter (in the TIBCO sense) style
components on. One of the [advertised][ADV] features of the new release
is a newly written 'Getting Started Guide', so this may be a good
opportunity to have another look. [NK]: http://www.1060.org/ [ADV]:
