Apparently (according to [this][MACO]) Mac Office is 30,000,000 lines of
code, that's a lot of code to try to keep bug free! Out of curiosity, I
downloaded [a utility to count lines of code][NCSS] and found that
[RvSnoop][RVSN] is only ~7,000 lines of code. That's only counting
non-comment lines, I don't know how well commented the MS codebase is.
Not that there's any real comparison in functionality between the two of
course!
