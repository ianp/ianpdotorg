A new development version of [RvSnoop][RVS] is now available for
[download][DL]. This version adds:

* Saving and restoring messages between sessions.

* Remove Connection as a context sensitive menu option.

* Improved drag and drop support.

And also fixes some bugs
involving the screen menu on Mac OS X. The save and restore messages
option writes the selected records from the ledger to a ZIP based binary
file format (it's the same format that is used internally by the copy
and paste mechanism). The format has also been enhanced to include
subject information for the messages, as this is stripped out by the raw
Rendezvous library calls.
