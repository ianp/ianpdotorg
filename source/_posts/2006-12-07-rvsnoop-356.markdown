A new development build of [RvSnoop][RVS] is available for
[downloading][DL]. This release contains all of the features that will
be in the finished 1.6 release, due out sometime next week. Changes from
the last development build include: \* Added support for republishing on
different connections. \* Added column to ledger to display wire size of
messages. \* Fixed bug that caused republished messages to be filtered
incorrectly from the subject hierarchy. \* Fixed bug with ledger
renderer which caused striping to break when columns were added/removed
from the view. \* Minor code clean-ups and removal of a couple of unused
methods. \* Updated the FAQs page with correct details of timestamp
formatting in ledger (this hasn't been pushed out to the public site
yet). The only things left to do now (assuming no new bugs are found)
are some additional testing and documentation updates. [RVS]:
