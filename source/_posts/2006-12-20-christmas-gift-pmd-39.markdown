Just in time for Christmas, [Tom Copeland][TC] has [announced][ANN] a
new release of [PMD][PMD] with some notable speed increases. Hopefully
this will make it fast enough to use the [Eclipse plug-in][EP] in
regular development, rather than having a separate ‘analysis’ phase to
clean up any warts before each release. [ANN]:
