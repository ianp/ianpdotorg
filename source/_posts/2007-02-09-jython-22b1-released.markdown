The first beta of Jython 2.2 has [been released][DL]! Jyhon scripting is
something that I'm planning to add to [RvSnoop][RV] so I'm quite
interested in this, especially given the current focus of development is
making the codebase easier to understand for new developers, I've looked
at it fairly recently and at the moment it's quite a tangle!
