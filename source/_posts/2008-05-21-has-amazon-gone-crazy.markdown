I've just been looking at getting a copy of the newly released Cocoa
Programming 3rd Edition (tip o' the hat to [Scott Stevenson][5]) and, as
the link from there is to the [U.S. Amazon site][3] I saw the price
there:

then going to my local [U.K. based Amazon page][4] to place an order and:

{% img /images/2008/05/21/cocoa-programming-uk.png %}

well, what
the fuck is that all about exactly? Check out the [conversion rates][6]:

> Wednesday, May 21, 2008
> 28.79 British Pound = 57.526 US Dollar
> 28.79 US Dollar (USD) = 14.991 British Pound (GBP)
> Interbank rate +/- 2%

That's getting on for sixty bucks! almost twice the price of the US site. That's just fucking ridiculous.
