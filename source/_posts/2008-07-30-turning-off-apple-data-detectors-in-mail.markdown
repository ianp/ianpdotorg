Apparently [Michael Tsai doesn't like][1] the data detectors feature in
Leopard. Personally I \_love\_ it. For those of you who don't know, data
detectors is a feature that adds smart links to chunks of text based on
what it thinks the text describes. For example, one feature that I use
all the time in Mail is the detector that turns any date or time into a
link allowing you to add it to iCal as an event. The really neat thing
about it is how it can scan the entire post to come up with information
to fill in about the event -- even looking at different regions of text
scattered throughout a mail. It's pretty neat and is exactly the type of
thing that [Wil Shipley][2] is talking about [here][3] when he mentions
adding features to your apps that constantly surprise users in a good
way (I've seen designers from BMW talk about the same thing in the
context of styling their car interiors). [1]:
