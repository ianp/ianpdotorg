[InfoQ][1] are one of my favourite tech information sites anyway and the
signal to noise ratio there is normally pretty high, they've got 3 great
new presentations out today:

* in [Herding Racehorses, Racing Sheep][2], Dave Thomas talks about the problems of treating developers
as interchangeable cogs (or _fungible resources_, as the project
management crowd would say). Some great ideas for bringing new team
members up to speed quickly (about 18 minutes in);

* in [The Top 10 Ways to Botch Enterprise Java Scalability and Reliability][3], Cameron
Purdy of Oracle talks about scaling Java. Obviously it's not an
impartial view but his points are good ones and it's an interesting
talk;

* in [Domain-Driven Design in an Evolving Architecture][4], Mat
Wall and Nik Silver talk about their experiences applying DDD at the
[Guardian's web site][5], it covers why they selected DDD as a method as
well as the benefits that they feel it brought. I've heard them talk
about this before, on [SE Radio][8], and to be honest, it worked better
in that format I thought - the written version here needs to be edited
down to about half it's current length;

* finally, [Rebecca Wirfs-Brock talks about][6] the benefits of, and problems of conducting,
architectural reviews. I've listened to some of this before as Rebecca
did an [interview][7] with [SE Radio][8] a while back, but this is good
for people who haven't heard her talk before.
