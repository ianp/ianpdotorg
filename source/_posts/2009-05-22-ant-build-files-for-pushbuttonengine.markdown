I've started to work up some standard build files for [PBE][01] based
projects, more information can be had [here][02], and here are the build
files for [libraries (components)][03], and for [applications (both SWF
and Air)][04]. \*Update (2009-05-24):\* updated the build files to work
better with pure AS3 projects (i.e. with no MXML files). [01]:
