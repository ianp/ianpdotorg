[GameSetWatch][01] is reporting about a new ['motion-based erotic
game'][02] for the Nokia N95: \> Players have to move and tilt their
phone along with the game's music ..., Play also seems to use the
handset's vibration function in some manner. Oh yeah, I'll just bet it
does! [01]: http://www.gamesetwatch.com/ "GameSetWatch home page" [02]:
