This looks like a mistake: [Rip: A Next Generation Ruby Packaging System][01]. One of the things that Ruby does really well is library
packaging, [RubyGems][02] may have some flaws but it basically works
really well. Contrast this with the situation in Python where there are
a number of different packaging systems (see, e.g. [this discussion][03]
by Ian Bicking), and it's just a mess---this stands out all the more as
Python normally follows a 'one way to do it' approach. Hopefully this
attempt to fork the Ruby packaging world will be dead on arrival.

Tip o'
the hat to [Ryan Tomayko][04] for pointing this out.
