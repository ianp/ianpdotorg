Just in time for the weekend, the SF [NoSQL][01] community have put up a [collection of talks and slides][02] from their recent get together. I’ll have more to say after I’ve had a chance to look these over…

*Update:* not actually a new set of talks, these have been online for about 6 months now, but it’s the first time that I’ve seen them…
