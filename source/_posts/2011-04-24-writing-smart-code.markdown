This quote has been doing the rounds lately, at least I've seen it on two or three different blogs, most recently [here](http://shapeof.com/archives/2011/04/regarding_simplicity.html)â€¦

{% blockquote Brian Kernighan %}
> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
> Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by
> definition, not smart enough to debug it.
{% endblockquote %}

I rather like that.
