It seems that the New York Post have decided to block all access to their site from iPads, telling users to download their (subscription only) app instead. As [Scripting News][SN] said…

> I wonder how Apple feels about this? I can't imagine they like it. I can see the ads now. ‘Get an Android tablet to read the web.’ Hmmm… I wonder how long said app will remain in the store after pulling a trick like this?
