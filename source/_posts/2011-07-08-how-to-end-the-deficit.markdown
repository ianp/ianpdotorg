{% blockquote Warren Buffet, CNBC http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/07/warren-buffett-i-could-end-the-deficit-in-5-minutes/ %}
> I could end the deficit in 5 minutes. You just pass a law that says
that anytime there is a deficit of more than 3% of GDP all sitting
members of congress are ineligible for reelection.
{% endblockquote %}

He's talking about the US Congress, but it would work here as well.
