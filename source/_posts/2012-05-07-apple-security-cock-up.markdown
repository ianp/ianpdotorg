[This][ZD] doesn't look good.

Apple's approach to security in general is a bit worrying: one the one hand they seem to have the right approach to securing the OS with App Store entitlements (although these aren't without [issues][EE]) and [Gatekeeper][GK], but their timeliness in shipping security fixes leaves a lot to be desired. Note from the article that this flaw was pointed out to them *3 months* ago!
