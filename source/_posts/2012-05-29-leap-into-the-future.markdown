![Leap Motion](/2012/05/29/leap-motion.jpg)

[This][LM] looks like a fascinating piece of technology provided it works as advertised. Check out the video on their, it looks pretty slick.

The company behind it make some pretty [bold claims][LA] about the technology:

> Just about the size of a flash drive, the Leap can distinguish your individual fingers and track your movements down to a 1/100th of a millimeter.
> ...
> Setup is just as intuitive.  Plug the LEAP into a USB port.  Load the Leap Motion software. Do a quick wave to calibrate. Thatâ€™s it.

Of course if you were to use it as a main input device I expect that you'd get tired pretty quickly, but for short sprints of use in specialist applications it looks neat.

And I'd love to see it paired with one the [new sets][VW] of VR displays that are hitting the market right now.
