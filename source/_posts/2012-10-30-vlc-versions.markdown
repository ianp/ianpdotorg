So I started up [VLC][V] just now and was greeted with this update notification:

> VLC media player 2.0.4
> 
> This is a **major update** that fixes a lot of regressions of the 2.0.x branch of VLC.
> 
> We are introducing an important number of fixes and improvements for all playback, notably for Blu-Ray, DVD, HLS, Ogg and MKV files; but also for Youtube, Vimeo, Koreus and Soundcloud.
> 
> New support for the OPUS audio codec, including multichannel and streams.
> ...

How the fuck is going from 2.0.3 to 2.0.4 the correct version bump for a *major* upgrade?

Jeez...
