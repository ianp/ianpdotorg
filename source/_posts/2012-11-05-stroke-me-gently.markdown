Excellent [article][A] over at [Gizmodo][G] about the whole security theatre dance that we're forced to do any time we want to fly these days. My favourite quote:

> I don’t have a problem with being searched at all – in fact, if you guys think it’s necessary, I’d be the first to admit that I look a little bit suspicious before I’ve had my first cup of coffee in the morning – but if you’re going to stroke me gently in front of hundreds of people, you’d better buy me a fucking drink first, is all I am saying.
